# Modules
TNE uses a module-based system to provide extra features. Certain "extras" are provided in the TNE core to give modules 
certain helper classes, such as item names, and inventory helpers.

## About
Modules are separate jars that provide extra features for TNE, and are located in the "modules" directory of the TNE folder.
The module system allows features to be added without the need to update the main TNE Plugin, and allows third-party developers to easily add addition features to TNE.

## Commands
These are the base commands associated with modules.

| /tnemodule load                        | /\<base command\> l                  | tne.module.load     | Used to load a module.                                                                |

## Advantages
There's various advantages of switching to a module-based system. Here's the major ones:
- Ability to update individual modules, without needed to mess with the core plugin itself
  - This allows bug fixes to be pushed out without everyone needing to update their version of TNE.
- Third-party developers may extend TNE without creating an entire plugin, and without messing around with Bukkit Events, or any API.
- Ability to add features to TNE without needing server owners to update TNE. This allows servers to add the latest TNE 
features without needing to restart their server, or perform the ever risky /reload command. All you have to do is simply type /tnemodule update, or /tnemodule reload.
